# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### Kotlin codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec and API.


### [Demo]()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Kotlin** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Kotlin** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

This repository contains a modularized gradle project for multiplatform RealWorld clients built using the [Kotlin Multiplatform Gradle plugin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/building-mpp-with-gradle.html).

Note on project structure: while the code in this repo works in every project, the file and folder layouts are in some cases not default.
These deviations will be called out where possible and you can see these modifications in `build.gradle` files.
